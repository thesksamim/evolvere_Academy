            <h1> Building Education Of Future!</h1>
            <p>We are creating a Student centered curriculum along with teaching methods based on "learning with
                experience". Evolvere Academy is at the forefront of innovation in education, using current tech
                in school curriculum. Our focus is on "real world learning" for your student to prepare them for
                the ever-changing future. We develop courses for k-12 to learn beyond regular schooling.
                We teach kids using different teaching methods; project based learning, gaming, case studies,
                working on real life problems. We also provide skills training and apprenticeship at school level
                and make students job ready as they turn 18.</p>
